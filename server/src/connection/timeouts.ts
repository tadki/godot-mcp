// Single source of truth for the command-timeout cascade (#276).
//
// Most MCP commands answer in milliseconds and run under one fixed socket
// timeout (QUICK_TIMEOUT_MS). A few legitimately run a while in-game
// (game_time step/step_until, input sequences with long timelines or capture
// offsets). For those, the server sizes its socket timeout from the tool's
// declared in-game budget and pushes the derived sub-budgets DOWN into the
// command params, so the editor relay and the game bridge stop hand-rolling
// their own magic numbers and inherit a correct stagger automatically.
//
// The layers, innermost first — each must answer BEFORE the one above it gives
// up, so a timeout surfaces as a typed error from the layer that hit it rather
// than a generic socket kill that orphans work below:
//
//   in-game budget      game-ms a step advances / the span an input sequence covers
//   bridge wall budget  = budget + slop (frame overrun, capture render)   [game bridge]
//   editor relay wait   = ready-wait + bridge wall budget + relay margin  [editor addon]
//   server socket       = editor relay wait + server margin               [this server]
//
// All values are wall-clock milliseconds. Define the margins ONCE here; every
// layer derives from this, so the stagger cannot drift and a new long-running
// tool inherits a correct cascade for free.
