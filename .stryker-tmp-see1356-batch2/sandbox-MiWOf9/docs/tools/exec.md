# Game Script Execution Tools

Run GDScript inside the running game for test scenario setup: one-shot state mutations plus persistent holder-managed nodes, behind a denylist accident guard.

## godot_exec

Execute GDScript inside the RUNNING game process — the scenario-setup primitive: grant weapons, skip waves, spawn entities, arm persistent test bots, without baking debug hooks into game code. Errors when no game is running. For launch-time setup, compose: godot_editor_edit run frozen=true -> godot_exec run (mutate state, attach bots under `holder`) -> godot_game_time thaw. A static denylist rejects accidental process/file-write escape (OS.execute and its spawn/shell siblings, DirAccess, write-mode FileAccess, ResourceSaver, ProjectSettings.save, EditorInterface) and names the offending token — an accident guard, NOT a security boundary. Compile errors reject the call with the parser message; runtime errors come back in runtime_errors with the call still completing.

### Actions

#### `run`

Run one-shot GDScript inside the running game and return its value

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `source` | string | Yes | GDScript statements, compiled as a function body. In scope: every autoload by its own name (e.g. `G.wave = 5`), `tree` (SceneTree), `root` (root Window) — the same context as step_until predicates — plus `holder`, a Node that survives scene reloads: attach nodes under it for behavior that persists between tool calls (a Timer-driven guard, an autofire bot), then manage them with list/remove/clear. Holder children pause with the tree, so a bot armed under a freeze acts only after thaw/step. Use an explicit `return` to get a value back (there is no implicit return): the value comes back STRUCTURED — containers (Array/Dictionary/packed arrays) and Vector/Color natives serialize recursively to JSON; Node/Object/Resource come back as compact reference metadata (class + path + repr), never the object graph. Budget gates: nesting depth 8 and node count 512 (each trips a `result_truncated` marker naming the reason; a payload over the byte cap GODOT_MCP_EXEC_MAX_BYTES (default 64 KB) downgrades to a capped JSON preview with reason "bytes"). `result_repr` carries the legacy str() preview for transitional consumers. print() output is not returned — use return values (or, when the minimal-godot-mcp companion server is installed, its get_console_output). Function bodies cannot declare top-level func/class — use lambdas for callbacks, or build a sub-script with GDScript.new() and set_script() it onto a holder child for _process-driven behavior. No `await` (synchronous-only; compose with godot_game_time to wait). A runtime error or failed assert() breaks the game into the editor debugger mid-call; the relay auto-resumes it and the error comes back in runtime_errors (any debugger break in the call window is resumed, including a breakpoint hit by unrelated game code). |
| `budget_ms` | integer | No | Wall-clock patience for the call, used to size the timeout cascade (default 10000, max 30000). NOT enforcement: a synchronous script cannot be preempted, so an infinite loop hangs the game past any budget — recover with godot_editor_edit stop. |

#### `list`

List the nodes currently attached under the exec holder (name, class, age, processing state)

*No parameters.*

#### `remove`

Remove one exec holder child by name (queue_free)

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Yes | Node name as reported by list |

#### `clear`

Remove every exec holder child (queue_free all)

*No parameters.*
