// Shared shape + advisory formatting for the project.godot staleness signal the
// editor addon attaches when project.godot was edited on disk after the editor
// loaded it, leaving its in-memory ProjectSettings / InputMap stale (#245). The
// addon owns the human-readable `summary` (single source of truth for the
// wording); the server just surfaces it. The field is optional everywhere:
// absent / not-stale is treated as "no advisory", which is also what an older
// addon that never sends it produces — so this is version-skew safe.
